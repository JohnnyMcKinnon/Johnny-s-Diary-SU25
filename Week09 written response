Written Response for Week09 HashTable: (I originally shared a google doc with you for my week 9 code and week 8 reflection. 
The google doc is called Week 9 code submission: Johnny McKinnon)

My code was pretty on point in terms of the added methods for the assignment and is syntactfully accurate. 
My code accurately counts how many nodes are used using “totalNodes” and occupied slots using “usage”. 
My code then rehashes to (2X) of whatever the initial node count is, and most importantly, resets the totalNode count 
and usage count, and then re-evaluates the count after rehashing. Once the nodes fill up 75%(¾), the array is then 
duplicated with 2x as many node slots, and the data get redistributed to further spread the data.
