Written Response for Week03 TrainLine:
Reflecting on heapifyUp assignment, I got the code perfect, I understood the restrictions on while loop for swap,
my comments were spot on and my syntax was proficent. Something that was different, not exactly wrong, was our actual swap
line. While your code is 'perfect' my code runs with proficency. The hardest part about coding, for me, is that there 
really are no 'wrong' answers, just effective and ineffective. Since I have such a broad range of how to do something, 
finding most efficent way is sometimes frusterating and tedious. I feel confident in this weeks coding assigment, I think
the tail node is pretty simplistic, and we pretty much went over the answers in class, so the assignment wasn't too bad.
