Written Response for Week06 DynamicArray:
My code from my personal respository for week5 is nonexistant, despite me submitting work for the assignment. 
I sent assignment an email explaining the situation,but I have completed every assignment, but when I went to my 
own repository for week 5, nothing was added. I think I may have edited yours as suggested comments or something, 
but I know I always click commit changes and sync whenever I am done writing my code. But from what I remember writing,
I vividly remember changing the magic number 2 to RESIZE_FACTOR and from seeing your code on how the methods should've 
looked, my work was along the same lines. I was done with my code and I was looking it over and I caught the magic number
so I had to resubmit the work from codespaces after I already clicked the commit button, but not the sync button.
(Could that have messed it up?) I did test my code and it passed the testing code. I made the variables for 1 
instead of using magic numbers. I started writing the code on Tuesday, and I remember having issues pulling up the
assignment, but I eventually opened a codespaces for the assignment to then complete it. I put a lot of effort into these
homework assignments as I am not the best coder, or GiHub user, it takes me that much longer to write my code, and not 
seeing my work was draining. But I am looking forward to our hash table homework assignment, I really understood the
concept of hotel rooms assigned by the first letter of the name or the hammock analogy. I think I got it in the bag.
